<!-- Create an admin panel (index.html), which will have a form to accept data.
Form will have the following fields :-
Type
Description
Price
Image URL
Use local storage as your database.

Each product should be stored in an array and this array will be stored in local storage.

Provide a “Add Product” button to add the data to local storage.

Create a “Show Products” button at the top which will redirect you to “inventory.html”

Create a product display page (inventory.html), Where all the products stored in the local storage will be displayed.
Each new product data should get appended next to each other in grid format.

Each product should have a “Remove” button as a part of its HTML.
On clicking on remove, the product should be removed from the DOM as well as the local storage.
Add a “Add More Product” button at the top which will redirect you to index.html. -->
