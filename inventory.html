<!-- Create a “Show Products” button at the top which will redirect you to “inventory.html”

Create a product display page (inventory.html), Where all the products stored in the local storage will be displayed.
Each new product data should get appended next to each other in grid format.

Each product should have a “Remove” button as a part of its HTML.
On clicking on remove, the product should be removed from the DOM as well as the local storage.

Add a “Add More Product” button at the top which will redirect you to index.html. --> -->
